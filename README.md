To execute the Employee Management System project, follow the steps below:
copy all the command and paste in terminal
1. ksh --version (If not install then Install)
2. mkdir employee_management
3. cd employee_management
4. touch employee.data deactive.data
5. echo "employee_id:1000" > employee_latest_id.in
6. chmod +x create.ksh delete.ksh update.ksh view.ksh menu.ksh
7. ./menu.ksh




The system consists of several scripts, each designed to handle a specific aspect of employee management:

create.ksh - Create Employee Record:

Functionality:
    Takes input for various employee details like Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Date of Joining, Line Manager ID, Designation, Department, Phone Number, and Email Address.
    Validates each input to ensure data integrity.
    Appends the new employee data to the employee.data file.
    Automatically increments the Employee ID for the next entry.
    Input Fields:
        Employee ID (auto-generated)
        First Name
        Last Name
        Date of Joining
        Line Manager ID
        Designation
        Department
        Phone Number
        Email Address
        
Validation:
    Alphabetic checks for names, designation, and department.
    Numeric checks for Employee ID, Line Manager ID, and Phone Number.
    Format validation for Date of Joining and Email Address.
    delete.ksh - Deactivate Employee Record:

Functionality:
    Takes an Employee ID as input.Marks the employee's status as "Deactive" in the employee.data file.
    Moves the deactivated employee's record to a deactive.data file.
Validation:
    Ensures the Employee ID exists before deactivating the record.
    update.ksh - Update Employee Record:

Functionality:
    Allows the user to update various fields of an existing employee record.
    Offers a menu to choose which field to update (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Designation, etc.).
    Replaces the old record with the updated data in the employee.data file.
Validation:
    Similar to the create.ksh script, ensuring updated data meets the required format.
    view.ksh - View Employee Record:

Functionality:
    Takes an Employee ID as input.
    Displays all the details of the corresponding employee.
    Provides a formatted output showing the employee's personal and professional details.
Validation:
    Ensures the Employee ID exists before displaying the data.
    menu.ksh - Main Menu Interface:

Functionality:
    Provides a user-friendly menu interface to navigate through the various operations (Create, Deactivate, Update, and View employee records).
    Continuously loops until the user chooses to exit.
              Options:
                      1: Create New Employee Record
                      2: Deactivate Employee Record
                      3: Update Employee Record
                      4: View Employee Record
                      5: Exit

                      
Data Files:
    employee.data:
        Stores active employee records with fields separated by #.
    deactive.data:
        Stores deactivated employee records.
    employee_latest_id.in:
        Maintains the latest Employee ID to ensure unique IDs for new entries.

        
Execution Flow:
      Start the system using the menu.ksh script.
      Select an option from the menu to perform a specific operation (Create, Deactivate, Update, View).
      Input data as prompted, with each field undergoing validation to ensure correctness.
      View results or confirmation messages, with data being saved or updated in the respective data files.

      
Use Cases:
      HR Departments: Can utilize this system to manage employee records efficiently.
      Project Teams: Can adapt and integrate this system into larger employee management applications.
      Learning & Practice: A good project for those learning shell scripting and understanding basic CRUD operations in a Unix/Linux environment.

      
Key Features:
      Simple and efficient CLI-based employee management.
      Robust data validation to ensure data integrity.
      Modular script design for easy maintenance and updates.

      
Next Steps:
      Enhancements: Consider adding features like searching by fields, generating reports, or integrating with a database.
      Testing: Ensure the scripts handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
      Documentation: Create detailed documentation for users and developers.
      This project offers a comprehensive solution for basic employee management using shell scripts and can be a solid foundation for more complex systems. Let me know if you need any further details!
